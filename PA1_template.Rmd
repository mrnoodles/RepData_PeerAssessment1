## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
clean_activity <- activity[complete.cases(activity), ]
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
clean_days <- split(clean_activity$steps, clean_activity$date, drop=TRUE)

for (i in 1:length(clean_days))
    clean_days[i] = sum(clean_days[[i]])
    
    clean_sum <- as.numeric(clean_days)

hist(as.numeric(clean_sum), breaks=53)

print(paste0("The mean is ", mean(clean_sum)))
print(paste0("The median is ", median(clean_sum)))


```
